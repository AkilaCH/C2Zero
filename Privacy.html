        </p>
        <li class="topic">How can data be deleted?</li>
        <p>
          If you are registered as a user in https://portal.c2zero.net, you can request data deletion (via email to
          privacy@c2zero.net from the user profile https://portal.c2zero.net/myprofile). Information will be deleted
          from our CRM upon request to privacy@c2zero.net or from the user profile https://portal.c2zero.net/myprofile.
          We undertake to perform the deletion within a day (24 hours) and will send you a confirmation once the
          information has been deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in advance of the
          deadline. This data is deleted from the system immediately after the above mentioned period (24 hours) and
          cannot be recovered by any users. Data which has been deleted or otherwise destroyed can not be recovered at
          any time. Sufficient warning is given to the account administrator before data is permanently deleted. Data
          destruction ensures that C2Zero manages the data it controls and processes it in an efficient and responsible
          manner. During the retention period for the data as outlined, C2Zero will actively destroy the data covered by
          this policy. Any exceptions to this data retention policy must be approved by C2Zero’s data protection offer
          in consultation with legal counsel. In rare circumstances, a litigation hold may be issued by legal counsel
          prohibiting the destruction of certain documents. A litigation hold remains in effect until released by legal
          counsel and prohibits the destruction of data subject to the hold.
